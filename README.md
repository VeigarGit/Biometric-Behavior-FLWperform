# Abstract

In this new era of mobile devices with many types of sensors, IoT, and other devices with sensitive data, much of this data is shared for application apps. A smartphone can collect this data and use this data in machine learning approaches, and a request for this process is to use them with more user security. These sensors can collect biometric behaviors from users during their devices. Thus for a behavioral identification system using the mobile device's data without sharing their focus on data security on user authentication. This paper introduces a Federated Learning approach for defining an accelerometer and gyroscope using a unique identifier to identify a user's behavior for continuous user identification. This study used several convolutional neural networks (CNN) to evaluate their performance for IoT devices. Thus, we will analyze its computational effort and evaluate its best parameters to identify the user in 2 seconds.
